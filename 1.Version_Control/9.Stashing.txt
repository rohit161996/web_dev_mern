- Stashing 
- If we have some local changes then we will not be able to do git pull untill we take backup of
  the files locally or stash those changes.

- Command to stash the changes on to the git
>> git stash list

- After this we can pull the code from the server
>> git pull

- After this if we wan our code back use command
>> git stash apply

- If we receive the merge conflict then resolve the conflict and commit the changes.
